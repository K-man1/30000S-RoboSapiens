We started the CAD of our robot with a drivetrain. So far, we are sticking with the same drivetrain as last time, a 450 RPM 2.75 inch wheel drivetrain. We did this because it honestly carried us at our last competition, and was fine with torque and good speed.

The CAD itself took around 3 hours cuz Fusion is... Fusion.
  

## 11/5/2025 - Asterisk Drive   

We recently saw a video by VEX alumni(7862U) that used a really "unknown" drivetrain, called the asterisk drive. Its basically an omnidirectional X-Drive with 2 omni-wheels, for extra pushing power. We thought this was an interesting idea and might implement it.

Due to the lack of information on this drivetrain, research and CAD took us a while.
