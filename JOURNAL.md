We started the CAD of our robot with a drivetrain. So far, we are sticking with the same drivetrain as last time, a 450 RPM 2.75 inch wheel drivetrain. We did this because it honestly carried us at our last competition, and was fine with torque and good speed.

The CAD itself took around 3 hours cuz Fusion is... Fusion.
