**Project Description:**
Our project was a front-to-back robot for the VEX V5 2025-2026 Push Back season. The robot's design is to have a floating intake at the front to intake blocks, use a ramp to bring them up with flaps, and score them into the long goal. We also use a double-park mechanism to park over a 1-inch barrier. We use pneumatics, coding, and mechanical building techniques to enhance our robot's capabilities in competition.

**Reason We Made this Robot:**
We made this project because our robot was honestly SOOO bad. It sucked at scoring, park was horrible, it was slow, broke 3/8 matches at an event and was not fun to drive. So, we decided to rebuild with a completely different design as its easier yet much better at scoring.
